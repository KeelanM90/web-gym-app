# Web Gym App
As part of our Web Development module we were asked to create a web app that allows users to sign up, edit their details and add assessments to their profile. Part of the assignment spec was to include trainers which would be able to login,comment on and view members assessments and delete members from the gym.

The web app is deployed to Heroku at [keelan-gym-app.herokuapp.com](http://keelan-gym-app.herokuapp.com).
To login as a trainer use the email ned@flanders.com and password **secret**. To login as a member use the email homer@simpson.com and password **secret**. You can also sign up as a member, as emails/passwords are not encrypted it is strongly recommended you use fictional details.

## Installation
To run the project locally install Play (See Built With heading for link). Clone the project to a directory. Navigate in command prompt to the directory the project was cloned to. Switch to the final release for running the project locally using the following command:
```sh
git checkout Release_V8_(Final_local_version_of_app,_including_tagged_information_view)
```

To start the server run the following command:
```sh
play run
```
In a browser of your choice visit [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view the website.
